This is the main ESP32 and PCA9685 sketch. In hopes of possibly continuing with this project in the future, I have simplified the sketch significantly, by using multiple header files to handle
different aspects of the robots arm, whether it be calculating IK, smoothing arm movements, or just the html for the UI.

To operate this code, upload it and look at the serial to get the IP address. Then connect to the wifi networks called "ESP32_Robot_Arm". Finally, paste this into your browser and you're done!

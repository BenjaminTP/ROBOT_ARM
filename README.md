# ROBOT_ARM_2.0
This is the code to our 4DOF robot arm! Made by Andrew Bai, Gabe Tirona, and Benjamin Tran-Pugh.

The main files for this project are in the MAIN_SKETCH directory, and contain full inverse kinematics, a WiFi server, smoothed robotic motion that can be sped up or slowed down, and predetermined positions that can also be overwritten with the save button.

This is the repository containing most of the files created during the building process. Many of the files in MATLAB, PYTHON, and C++ directories were made purely to test our inverse kinematic calculations. ARDUINO_SKETCHES and ESP32_SKETCHES contain sketches that can be uploaded with different functionality for each sketch.

To help guide you through this repository, most directories have a seperate short README to give context to the files in that directory, additionally, most files have a comment at the top of the file with explanation of the function of that file specifically.

Note that if any AI was used, it has been explicitly acknowledged in the code.
